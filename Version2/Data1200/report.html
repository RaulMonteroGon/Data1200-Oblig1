                     <p>Group 12 decided to work on Assignment b. We started with creating a mockup version of the Restaurant website. Our goal was to
                          make it simple, easy navigated and readable. Through the program Adobe XD we made two pages, consisting of a “Home” and “Menu”:</p>
                </div>

                <div class= "package-img">
                    <img class="report-picture1" src="Pictures/Prototype 1.jpg" alt="main pic" >
                    <img class="report-picture1" src="Pictures/Prototype 1 part2.jpg" alt="main pic" >
                </div>

                <div class="package">
                    <p>We choose the color #363636 (light black) as a main and #707070 (grey) as a second and border color. The logo was created using Photoshop and inspired 
                        by the same color #363636 and using a custom font (handwriting-draft free-version) (DaFont, u.d.):</p>
                </div>

                <div class= "package-img">
                    <img  src="Pictures/Logo.jpg" alt="logo pic" >
                </div>

                <div class= "package">
                    <p>We choose a page with centered elements so it’s easier for the eye to keep up.
                         The navigation consists of “Home”, “Menu” and “Info”. The Menu is a dropdown button with “Lunch”, “Dinner” and “Snacks”. The website contains few and easy understanding concepts,
                          like the menus with some space between, allergens explained at the bottom, and maps with a 2D and 360° view.</p>

                    <p>We created two models, the first that was done before submitting it to “AChecker” and “Markup Validation”. 
                        Where we had to change elements (achecker, u.d.) (validator.w3, u.d.):</p>
                </div>

                <div class= "package">
                   <ul>
                        <p><li>• Create a class called dish-title in the Css and change the for the class.</li></p>
                        <p><li>• Fixed some "div" that were misplaced, they were not giving errors but you could see there was something wrong because of the warnings. </li></p>
                        <p><li>• Changed the "li" for "div" since they were giving errors in the buttons and added a class with the li characteristics. </li></p>
                        <p><li>• Removed the body section since it was giving error with the main div (Contect) </li></p>                     
                   </ul>

                   <p>At the end we checked all elements of the site. Tested multiple styles, like having the navigation bar with no border (square), border all around, testing with different type of 
                       maps, type of container divs, logos and generally readability. The page were uploaded to GitHub and worked through it.</p>
